# TV Slides
A simple app to display image slides and function as a digital signage solution. 

The main feature is the ability for multiple tvs to sync with each other so that the slides are always in sync, in practice this is to within about 0.25s (~1 round trip + processing). This is largely dependant on the internet connection. Tv's are also able to be assigned different schedules.
